# CMSIS-Zephyr

This repository contains an exemplary CMSIS solution file that can be used to build two Zephyr basic examples on two
different development boards. It can be easily adapted to other boards or examples. It uses Zephyr's `west` build
system to create the executable file for an application and the
[Arm CMSIS Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.vscode-cmsis-debugger) to flash download
and run the image on the target hardware.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that you have installed Zephyr as explained in the
> [Keil Studio documentation](https://mdk-packs.github.io/vscode-cmsis-solution-docs/zephyr.html).

## Quick start

- Clone this repository onto your machine.
- Open it in VS Code. It should install required extensions automatically.
- In the CMSIS view, click on **...**, use **Open Solution in Workspace**, and choose "zephyr".
- Press the **Manage Solution Settings** button. In the dialog, select the target board and application.
- Press the **Build solution** button to build the example.
- Press the **Load & Debug application** button to start a debug session.

> [!NOTE]
> Check that the **Arm CMSIS Solution** extension is at least v1.66.0.

### Switch to a different board

If you want to run the examples on a different board, simply edit the `Examples/Blinky/blinky.csolution.yml` or
`Examples/Threads/threads.csolution.yml` files:

```yml
  # List the packs that define the device and/or board.
  packs:
    - pack: Vendor::DFP
    - pack: Vendor::BSP

  # List different hardware targets that are used to deploy the solution.
  target-types:
    - type: SpecifyName
      board: Vendor::Boardname
      device: Vendor::Devicename
```

If your development board's [CMSIS board name](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/) and
[Zephyr board name](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html#) do not match, you need to add the correct
Zephyr board name like this:

```yml
  target-types:
    - type: B-L475-IOT01A
      board: STMicroelectronics::B-L475E-IOT01A
      device: STMicroelectronics::STM32L475VGTx
      variables:
        - west-board: disco_l475_iot1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to delete the previous `/out` and `/tmp` directories before saving the updated `*.csolution.yml` file,
> otherwise the solution might not load correctly.

## Use the Zephyr Terminal in CMSIS View

Keil Studio includes a built-in **Zephyr Terminal** that runs `west` commands directly inside the IDE. When the terminal opens, it automatically sets the example build folder as the working directory and configures the Zephyr environment.

Example `west` commands:

```bash
# Build the project
west build

# Open GUI configuration
west build -t guiconfig

# Generate RAM report
west build -t ram_report
```
